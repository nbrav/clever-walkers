Project title: Scalable brain-like cognitive architecture for virtual agents

Modelling computational and Biological Reinforcement Learning in virtual agents and performing navigation and collision-avoidance

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

1. Unity (works on version 2017.2.0f3 Personal)
2. Python (for plotting; works on version 2.7.6)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the brain: rl-brain directory includes scripts to run the brain network.

1. Compile the EmptyBrain.cpp file, and execute. There will be open sockets for UDP communication, waiting for Unity.

Running on Unity (): unity_project directory includes scripts need for Unity.

1. When inside Unity, run a Object with PopulateScene.cs script. It will generate (multiple) agents, running on QAgent.cs and ZombieAgent.cs scripts.
